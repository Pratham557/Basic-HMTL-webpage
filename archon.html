A paragraph is a distinct section of written text, typically composed of several sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. Paragraphs are fundamental for organizing written work, making it easier for readers to follow the author's train of thought and enhancing readability. They serve as building blocks for longer pieces of writing, like essays or articles, and help structure and clarify the presentation of information. 
Writing paragraphs - Ask The Elephant
Here's a more detailed look at the characteristics and functions of paragraphs:
Unity and Coherence:
Each paragraph should center around a single, unified idea. All sentences within a paragraph should relate to and support this central idea. 
Structure:
Paragraphs typically begin with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. The subsequent sentences provide explanation, evidence, examples, or analysis related to that topic. 
Readability:
Paragraphs break up large blocks of text, making the writing more visually appealing and easier to digest. They allow readers to pause, process information, and transition to new ideas. 
Logical Flow:
Paragraphs help establish a logical flow of ideas within a piece of writing. Each paragraph builds upon the previous one, guiding the reader through the overall argument or narrative. 
Functions:
Paragraphs can be used to introduce new characters, settings, or events in a story. They can also be used to present different aspects of an argument or to provide evidence and analysis.
